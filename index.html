                <h4 >Cabbage</h4>
                <p>They are middlingly sensitive and soil salinity. To nurture cabbages 
                    well 39-75 degree Fahrenheit is the best temperature. The seeds need 
                    to be kept inside before the last frost which is around 6-8 months. 
                    The seeds will be grown in nearly 4 months after 
                    that they are planted outdoor before 2-3 months of the frost.</p>

                <p>
                    Sorghum grows best where summers are quite warm, with daytime t
                    emperatures regularly topping 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Sandy soils in 
                    warm climates are especially g
                    sorghum because it withstands drought and
                     flooding better than corn does.</p>

                <h4>Pumpkins</h4>
                <p>
                    Pumpkins need a warm, sunny position, shelter from cold winds and 
                    moisture-retentive soil. In late May, start hardening off indoor-raised
                     plants, to acclimatise them to outdoor
                     conditions. Do this by moving them into a coldframe for a week.

                    Peas produce best yields and quality in cool and moist growing

                     best on a well-drained soil with an 
                    optimum pH of 6 to 7.7 and a high content of soil organic matter.

                    Image result for onions growth conditions
                    Onions are adapted to a wide range of temperatures and they are
                     frost tolerant. Leaf, root, and bulb development occurs in cool temperatures between 55° to 
                    75°F. Optimal onion leaf growth occurs at 68° to 77°F (20° to 25°C).</p>

                <h4>Wheat</h4>
                <p>Wheat needs 12 to 15 inches (31 to 38 centimeters) of water 
                    to produce a good crop. It grows best when temperatures are warm,
                     from 70° to 75° F (21° to 24° C), but not too hot. Wheat also 
                    needs a lot of sunshine, especially when the grains are filling.</p>

                <p>Lentils prefer loose, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. 
                    Lentils will grow in poor soil but the yield will be reduced. 
                    Lentils will not grow well in water-logged soil. 
                    Lentils grow best in a soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.5.</p>

                <p>Plant them 18 to 24 inches apart in a sunny, well-drained spot.
                     Pepper plants need at least 6-8 hours of sunlight per day. 
                     Mix compost or other organic matter into the soil when planting. 
                    Water immediately after planting, then regularly throughout the season.</p>

                <p>
                    A temperature of 21°C- 27°C and 50-100cm rainfall is suitable
                     for its cultivation. Alternate spells of rains and sunny weather 
                     are ideal for maize. It is a Kharif Crop but in some states like Bihar, it is grown in
                     the rabi season also. It grows well in alluvial and red soils with good drainage.</p>
