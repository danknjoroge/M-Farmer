                <p>They are middlingly sensitive and soil salinity. To nurture cabbages 
                    well 39-75 degree Fahrenheit is the best temperature. The seeds need 
                    to be kept inside before the last frost which is around 6-8 months. 
                    The seeds will be grown in nearly 4 months after 
                    that they are planted outdoor before 2-3 months of the frost.</p>

                <p>
                    Sorghum grows best where summers are quite warm, with daytime t
                    emperatures regularly topping 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Sandy soils in 
                    warm climates are especially g
                    sorghum because it withstands drought and
                     flooding better than corn does.</p>

                    Pumpkins need a warm, sunny position, shelter from cold winds and 
                    moisture-retentive soil. In late May, start hardening off indoor-raised
                     plants, to acclimatise them to outdoor
                     conditions. Do this by moving them into a coldframe for a week.

                    Onions are adapted to a wide range of temperatures and they are
                     frost tolerant. Leaf, root, and bulb development occurs in cool temperatures between 55° to 
                    75°F. Optimal onion leaf growth occurs at 68° to 77°F (20° to 25°C).</p>

                    to produce a good crop. It grows best when temperatures are warm,
                     from 70° to 75° F (21° to 24° C), but not too hot. Wheat also 
                    needs a lot of sunshine, especially when the grains are filling.</p>

                    Lentils will grow in poor soil but the yield will be reduced. 
                    Lentils will not grow well in water-logged soil. 
                    Lentils grow best in a soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.5.</p>
